# CloudKit

A toolkit for accessing user/saved game data on Valve's Steam network directly without going through the Steam client.

## Console Tool

Check out the source code for the tool for examples on downloading and uploading files by using a game's AppID. You can search and find ID's with [SteamDB](https://steamdb.info/apps/).
